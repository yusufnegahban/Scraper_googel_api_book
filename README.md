cool app that scrapes book info from a website, stores it in a database, and shows it on a simple web page.
It’s like a mini online bookstore! 😍

1️⃣ Data Scraping
Used Python with requests and BeautifulSoup to grab book info from books.toscrape.com
Scraped:
Book title
Author (improved later)
Price
Availability
Publish date

Handled pagination to scrape all pages one by one 📄➡️📄➡️📄
2️⃣ Data Storage
Used PostgreSQL to keep the data safe and organized
Created a Book model with SQLAlchemy to store book details in tables

Added search to find books by title or author 🔎
Added pagination (10 books per page)
Made a detail page to show full info of each book 📖
4️⃣ REST API
Created a REST API that serves book data in JSON format
Now you can use the API for other apps or future projects
5️⃣ Testing & Code Quality
Wrote simple tests using pytest to ensure the main page and API work ✅
Kept code clean, organized, and easy to maintain
6️⃣ Git & Version Control
Used Git to track project changes
Made clear and descriptive commits for every step
Created branches and pull requests like pros ✨
